### Social media and logo icon
- Each of the three buttons are active and lead to different social networks.
- They were designed deliberately simply without icons because they would divert attention from the icons that are important for the nature of the site.
- When the user hovers over them, they light up yellow.
- The logo icon is also active and leads to the top of the page.

### Compatibility and Responsive Testing
- I have tested that this page works on different browsers: Edge, Chrome, Safari.
- I confirm that this project is responsive and looks good on all the screen sizes using chrome dev tools.
- For the devices under 350px width it is recomended to use landscape mode.
- Every feature on the site performes good: active links in navbar, social media links, bottom logo button, as well as 
signupform which requres correct input on all fields.

### Outstanding Defects
- No outstanding defects, all issues logged on GitHub and solved.

### Defects of Note
1. The website was designed mostly for desktop users, so optimisation for mobile devices needed to be made. They occur on the breaking points characteristic for this page(putting icon in grid, text resizing, different hero image size to insure that original idea is mantained)
2. The original images were not in line with idea of site, so they were corrected to fit form and apperance.
3. Sticky navbar covered message for small screen users and hero image, so the whole body element was top-padded. 

## ACCESSIBILITY

### Lighthouse Audit
- The deployed website was run through lighthouse to check performance, accessibility, best practices and SEO scores.
