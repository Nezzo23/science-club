## Project Overview
- SCIENCE CLUB 51 is an association that gathers young people who have a passion for science.
- It got it's name from the former postal code of the place where it is located - Reinickendorf.
- Workshops in the fields of computer science, engineering, physics and mathematics are held according to the schedule for everyone who wants to expand their knowledge, as well as work on exciting projects.

### Manual Testing
- You can view manual testing of the website [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16XqjGOfWqQrNFe5B4ZjzjadKg1do8L6vFcukGPGYe8c/edit?usp=sharing)

### Outstanding Defects
- No outstanding defects, all issues logged on GitHub and solved.

### Defects of Note
1. The website was designed mobile-first which caused some challenges when resizing the fonts and navigation for larger screen sizes. Flexbox solved this and using % for font-size in the media queries.
2. The display of the site on an ultra-wide screen didn't look appealing, a wrapping container solved the issue with a max-width with the help of my mentor.  

## ACCESSIBILITY

### Lighthouse Audit
- The deployed website was run through [web.dev measure](https://web.dev/measure/) to check performance, accessibility, best practices and SEO scores.
